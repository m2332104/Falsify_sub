# Falsification of Cyber Physical Systems by Deep Reinforcement Learning

## What is this?

This package is to evaluate deep reinforcement learning technology for falsification of cyber-physical systems.  It contains four models (an auto-transmission model, a wind turbine model, a power train control model and an insulin model.  The insulin model currently does not work.

## Audience

This package is for researchers and developpers who evaluates the technology.


## Reqiurment

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Stateflow
- Decent distribution of Python
- ChainerRL
- s-taliro
- breach

## Agenda

- metascript.m : scripts for autotransmission, powertrain and insulin models
- metascript_wind_turbine.m : scripts for the wind turbine model.
